```bash
# For student registration
python -m attendance_system register --camera 0

# For attendance recognition
python -m attendance_system recognize --camera 0 --threshold 0.5

# Download required models
python -m attendance_system download
```

### Method 3: GUI Interface
```bash
python attendance_system/gui.py
```
Provides a graphical user interface for easy interaction.

### Method 4: Web Interface
```bash
python attendance_system/app.py
```
Runs a Flask web server (requires additional setup).

## üîß Configuration

### Recognition Threshold
- **0.3-0.5**: High sensitivity (may have false positives)
- **0.5-0.7**: Balanced (recommended)
- **0.7-0.9**: High precision (may miss some matches)

### Camera Settings
- Default: Camera index 0
- Resolution: 640x480 (configurable)
- Frame rate: 30 FPS

## üìä Usage Guide

### 1. Adding Students
1. Run the registration system
2. Enter student ID and name
3. Position face in camera view
4. System captures multiple face samples
5. Face embeddings are generated and stored

### 2. Taking Attendance
1. Run the recognition system
2. Students approach the camera
3. System recognizes faces in real-time
4. Attendance is automatically logged
5. Results displayed on screen

### 3. Managing Data
- **List Students**: View all registered students
- **Delete Student**: Remove specific student records
- **Set Threshold**: Adjust recognition sensitivity
- **View Logs**: Check attendance history

## üîÑ Updating Requirements

### Update All Dependencies
```bash
# Update all dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Update requirements.txt with current versions
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Update Specific Components
```bash
# Update AI/ML dependencies
pip install --upgrade torch torchvision onnxruntime insightface face-recognition

# Update web dependencies
pip install --upgrade flask flask-cors flask-socketio

# Update core dependencies
pip install --upgrade opencv-python numpy scipy
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Camera Not Found
```bash
# Check available cameras
python -c "import cv2; print([i for i in range(10) if cv2.VideoCapture(i).isOpened()])"
```

#### 2. AI Models Not Loading
```bash
# Download models manually
python -m attendance_system download --insightface
```

#### 3. Memory Issues
- Reduce frame resolution
- Close other applications
- Use CPU-only mode for AI models

#### 4. Recognition Accuracy Issues
- Adjust recognition threshold
- Add more face samples per student
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Clean camera lens

### Performance Optimization

#### For Better Speed
```bash
# Use GPU acceleration (if available)
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Reduce frame processing
# Set lower resolution in camera settings
```

#### For Better Accuracy
```bash
# Increase embedding samples per student
# Use ensemble recognition mode
# Ensure consistent lighting
```
