# Trusted Embedding System with Face Change Detection

## Overview

The Trusted Embedding System is an advanced feature that helps the face recognition attendance system adapt to changes in a person's face over time. It uses a trust-based approach with Face ID-like adaptive learning to improve recognition accuracy and reliability.

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Registration
- When a new student registers, their face embeddings are created with `"trusted": false`
- These initial embeddings are considered "untrusted" because they were captured in a controlled environment

### 2. Recognition Process with Confidence-Based Actions

#### **Low Confidence (< 50%)**
- No action taken
- System continues monitoring

#### **Face Change Detection (50-70%)**
- System detects that the person's face has changed
- Creates new embedding with `"face_change_detected": true`
- Helps adapt to:
  - Aging
  - Hairstyle changes
  - Weight changes
  - Different lighting conditions
  - Facial expressions
  - Glasses/no glasses

#### **High Confidence (> 70%)**
- If untrusted embedding matches, creates trusted embedding
- If trusted embedding matches, regular update (if enabled)

### 3. Adaptive Learning
- Over time, the system builds a collection of embeddings:
  - **Registration embeddings**: Initial untrusted embeddings
  - **Face change embeddings**: Adapt to appearance changes
  - **Trusted embeddings**: High-confidence real-world interactions
- This helps the system adapt to face changes over time

## JSON Structure

Each student's embeddings are stored in `database/embeddings/{student_id}.json`:

```json
{
  "student_id": "STUDENT001",
  "embeddings": [
    {
      "type": "insightface",
      "vector": [...],  // 512-dimensional embedding vector
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "capture_date": "2025-01-13T10:30:00",
      "source": "registration",
      "trusted": false
    },
    {
      "type": "insightface", 
      "vector": [...],
      "confidence": 0.65,
      "capture_date": "2025-01-13T14:15:00",
      "source": "face_change_update",
      "trusted": false,
      "face_change_detected": true
    },
    {
      "type": "insightface", 
      "vector": [...],
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "capture_date": "2025-01-13T16:30:00",
      "source": "trusted_update",
      "trusted": true
    }
  ],
  "created_date": "2025-01-13T10:30:00",
  "last_updated": "2025-01-13T16:30:00",
  "total_embeddings": 3
}
```

## Key Features

### 🔒 Trusted Embeddings
- Created when untrusted embeddings match with high confidence (>70%)
- Marked with `"trusted": true`
- Source: `"trusted_update"`

### 🔄 Face Change Embeddings
- Created when confidence is between 50-70%
- Marked with `"face_change_detected": true`
- Source: `"face_change_update"`
- Helps adapt to appearance changes

### 📝 Untrusted Embeddings  
- Created during initial registration
- Marked with `"trusted": false`
- Source: `"registration"`

### 🔄 Automatic Updates
- System automatically creates embeddings based on confidence levels
- No manual intervention required
- Helps maintain recognition accuracy over time

## Confidence-Based Actions

| Confidence Range | Action | Purpose |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| < 50% | No action | Continue monitoring |
| 50-70% | Create face change embedding | Adapt to appearance changes |
| > 70% | Create trusted embedding | High-confidence recognition |

## Benefits

1. **Adaptive Recognition**: System learns from real-world interactions
2. **Face Change Adaptation**: Automatically adapts to appearance changes
3. **Improved Accuracy**: Mix of trusted and face change embeddings
4. **Automatic Learning**: No manual retraining needed
5. **Historical Tracking**: Maintains all types of embeddings
6. **Face ID-like Behavior**: Similar to iPhone's adaptive learning

## Usage

### During Registration
```python
# New embeddings are automatically created as untrusted
updater.update_embedding(student_id, face_image, confidence, trusted=False)
```

### During Recognition (Automatic)
```python
# System automatically handles different confidence levels:
# 50-70%: Face change detection
# >70%: Trusted embedding creation
# <50%: No action
```

### Check Face Change Analysis
```python
# Analyze face changes for a student
analysis = updater.analyze_face_changes(student_id)
print(f"Face change frequency: {analysis['face_change_frequency']}")
print(f"Face change embeddings: {analysis['face_change_embeddings']}")
```

## Testing

Run the test scripts to verify the system works:

```bash
cd attendance_system

# Test trusted embedding system
python test_trusted_system.py

# Test face change detection
python test_face_change_system.py
```

## Configuration

The system uses these settings from `config/settings.py`:

- `EMBEDDING_UPDATE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: 0.8 (minimum confidence for updates)
- `MAX_EMBEDDINGS_PER_STUDENT`: 10 (maximum embeddings per student)
- `EMBEDDING_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: 300 (seconds between updates)

## Files Modified

1. `recognition/embedding_updater.py` - Added face change detection functions
2. `recognition/face_matcher.py` - Updated to handle confidence ranges
3. `test_face_change_system.py` - Test script for face change detection
4. `TRUSTED_EMBEDDING_README.md` - Updated documentation

## Future Enhancements

- Weighted voting based on embedding types
- Automatic cleanup of old embeddings
- Face change frequency analysis
- Manual controls for administrators
- Integration with attendance analytics
